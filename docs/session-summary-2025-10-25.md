# Session Summary - 2025-10-25

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Test Failures from Style Installation
**Problem**: External team introduced regression causing test failures
**Solution**: Fixed path resolution in `installCuratedStyles.ts` by removing `../` prefix
**Status**: COMPLETE

### 2. ✅ Right-Click Menu Modifications
**Problem**: Needed to remove two menu items and add new "Clear all CNE metadata"
**Solution**:
- Removed "Export CSL-JSON" and "Preview CNE Citation" menu items
- Added new "Clear all CNE metadata" with confirmation dialog
- Fixed indentation issue by removing icon property
**Status**: COMPLETE

### 3. ✅ Dynamic Author Fields Not Updating
**Problem**: When users modify creators, CNE panel didn't update automatically
**Solution**:
- Implemented creator change detection in `creatorChangeDetector.ts`
- Extended existing Notifier to monitor creator changes
- Added 300ms debouncing to avoid refreshing while user types
**Status**: COMPLETE

### 4. ✅ Author Fields Position Issue
**Problem**: New author fields appeared at end of form instead of correct position
**Solution**:
- Changed from `insertBefore()` DOM manipulation to complete rebuild strategy
- Collect non-author elements, determine insertion index, rebuild in correct order
- Preserves event listeners by using `removeChild()` instead of `innerHTML = ""`
**Status**: COMPLETE (awaiting user verification)

## Key Files Modified

1. `/src/modules/cne/styles/installCuratedStyles.ts` - Fixed bundled URL path
2. `/src/modules/cne/CneUIFactory.ts` - Added clear metadata functionality
3. `/src/modules/cne/section/renderer.ts` - Rewrote `refreshAuthorFields()` function
4. `/src/modules/cne/section/binding/languageBinding.ts` - Added creator change detection
5. `/src/modules/cne/section/binding/creatorChangeDetector.ts` - NEW file for change detection
6. `/addon/locale/en-US/addon.ftl` - Added localization strings
7. `/addon/locale/zh-CN/addon.ftl` - Added localization strings

## Technical Improvements

1. **DOM Manipulation Strategy**: Moved from direct `insertBefore()` to complete rebuild approach
2. **Event Preservation**: Using `removeChild()` loop to maintain event listeners
3. **Debouncing**: Added 300ms delay for creator changes to improve UX
4. **Container Identification**: Added unique class `cne-main-container` for reliable DOM queries

## Testing Notes

The latest changes should be tested by:
1. Opening an item with existing creators
2. Adding/removing creators in Zotero's native interface
3. Verifying author fields update in correct position immediately (not at end)
4. Checking that existing CNE data is preserved during refresh

## Next Steps

- User needs to verify the positioning fix works correctly
- Monitor for any performance issues with the rebuild approach
- Consider adding animation/transition for smoother visual updates
