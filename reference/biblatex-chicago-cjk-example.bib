  annote =      {One of the Manual's examples of an entry containing
                  non-Latin scripts as an aid for readers needing to
                  follow the reference.  Here the Chinese characters
                  from the original publication follow their romanized
                  versions with no intervening punctuation.  The
                  titleaddon field requires the two titleaddon options
                  to eliminate that punctuation, while the new
                  journaltitleaddon field uses the jtitleaddon option,
                  which defaults to a space and is therefore
                  unnecessary here.  The usere field, demonstrating
                  one of its usual functions in biblatex-chicago,
                  translates the title.  The author field shows how
                  the new cmsnameparts option works, the addition of a
                  "cjk" name part requiring that each part of the
                  name, romanized or not, is identified as here.  The
                  nametemplates option tells biblatex that it should
                  present all names in the entry, including their
                  romanized parts, in the conventional Chinese order
                  rather than the usual western one.  The inclusion of
                  the romanized version allows biblatex easily to
                  alphabetize this entry among others that use only
                  the Latin script.  (The \cmd{textzh} command here is
                  just a convenience shorthand I've set up using babel
                  commands in the preamble.  It tells babel to treat
                  the text as Chinese, and means I don't need to load
                  a more powerful and more complicated package just to
                  typeset a few words.)}
